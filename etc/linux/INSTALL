There are several ways of manually installing BDay.  The simplest is to copy
the "bday" executable into your existing path and copy the help directory to
one of the following locations:

  /usr/share/bday/help
  /usr/local/share/bday/help

Or into the same folder as the "bday" executable.

It would also be good to make a symbolic link to the bday executable for
running in quick mode.  If you had put bday in /usr/local/bin, then the
following command would set up the symbolical link:

  ln -s /usr/local/bin/bday /usr/local/bin/bdayquick

Another common install pattern is to unzip the binary distribution into either
/opt/bday or /usr/local/bday and then add the relevant symbolic links.  For
example:

  ln -s /opt/bday/bday /usr/local/bin/bday
  ln -s /opt/bday/bday /usr/local/bin/bdayquick

The bday.desktop and bday.png files can be used to create a menu entry for
BDay.  Copy the bday.png image file to where you store icon files (typically
/usr/share/icons or /usr/local/share/icons) and the bday.desktop to where you
store desktop short-cuts (typically /usr/share/applications or
/usr/local/share/applications.)  Edit bday.desktop and change the paths on the
Exec and Icon lines to the paths where you've installed everything.

If you do not have root access, you can still install bday in your personal
$HOME/bin folder, and put bday.desktop in $HOME/.local/share/applications.

After installing the desktop file you should be able to find BDay under
Utilities/Desktop.

There is also an RPM package available for automated install.
