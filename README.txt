BDay is a simple program to help you track birthdays and
anniversaries.  It runs when you start or log in to your computer,
displays any events that are coming up, and then exits when you click
OK.  It does not hang around in the system tray or as a background
process taking up your computer's resources.  If there are no events
to be displayed, then you wont even see BDay run.
