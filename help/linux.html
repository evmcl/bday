<h1><font color="#104A91">Running BDay Automatically Under Linux</font></h1>

<p>BDay can be run in &ldquo;quick&rdquo; mode in one of two ways:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Running with the &ldquo;<code>-q</code>&rdquo; or
    &ldquo;<code>--quick</code>&rdquo; command-line parameter.</li>
  <li>Running by calling &ldquo;<code>bdayquick</code>&rdquo;, which is a
    symbolic link to the <code>bday</code> main program.</li>
</ol>

<p>In quick mode, if there are no events to be displayed then BDay will exit
immediately.</p>

<p>You typically want to run this when the user logs into the computer.
Unfortunately, this is dependant on which window management system you are
using.  For instance, for KDE you could put a symbolic link into the
&ldquo;<tt>~/.kde/Autostart</tt>&rdquo; folder with a command such as:</p>

<blockquote><pre>ln -s /usr/bin/bdayquick ~/.kde/Autostart</pre></blockquote>

<p>(Depending on the distribution of Linux and the version of KDE being used,
the relevant folder may be &ldquo;<tt>~/.kde4/Autostart</tt>&rdquo;.)</p>

<p>For Gnome, you must open the System Preferences or Control Centre, select
Sessions and then add an entry in the Start Programs tab.</p>

<p>Another option is to run BDay at a scheduled time using <tt>cron</tt>.  To
edit your <tt>cron</tt> schedule, enter the following command at your
terminal/console prompt:</p>

<blockquote><pre>crontab -e</pre></blockquote>

<p>The following line would configure <tt>cron</tt> to run BDay at 5AM every
morning, so if there are events to be displayed, they will be there waiting for
you when you arrive at your computer in the morning:</p>

<blockquote><pre>0 5 * * * bdayquick</pre></blockquote>
