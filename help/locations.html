<h1><font color="#104A91">Events File Locations</font></h1>

<p>The location of events files depends on the operating system.</p>

<a name="microsoft-windows"></a>
<h2><font color="#104A91">Microsoft Windows</font></h2>

<p>The user events file is stored at:</p>

<blockquote><tt>C:\Documents&nbsp;and&nbsp;Settings\<em>user</em>\Application&nbsp;Data\bday.txt</tt></blockquote>

<p>Where &ldquo;<tt><em>user</em></tt>&rdquo; is the user's log in ID.</p>

<p>The system events file is stored at:</p>

<blockquote><tt>C:\Documents&nbsp;and&nbsp;Settings\All&nbsp;Users\Application&nbsp;Data\bday.txt</tt></blockquote>

<p>A third events file is also available in Microsoft Windows, the application
events file.  It is stored in the same folder as the <tt>bday.exe</tt> program
(usually &ldquo;<tt>C:\Program&nbsp;Files\bday</tt>&rdquo;.)</p>

<a name="linux"></a>
<h2><font color="#104A91">Linux</font></h2>

<p>The user events file is stored the user's home directory:</p>

<blockquote><tt>~/.bdayrc</tt></blockquote>

<p>The system events file is stored at:</p>

<blockquote><tt>/etc/bdayrc</tt></blockquote>

<p>Note that BDay also creates the directory &ldquo;<tt>~/.bday</tt>&rdquo; to
hold certain application properties.</p>

<h2><font color="#104A91">Including Other Event Files</font></h2>

<p>You can include another events file by entering the following line in one of
the above include files:</p>

<pre><code>include <em>filename</em></code></pre>

<p>Where &ldquo;<code><em>filename</em></code>&rdquo; is the full path and name
of the file to be included.</p>
